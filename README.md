# dual-axis-solar-tracking-system-using-arduino-uno
In this project photovoltaic conversion panel is to be used in an Arduino based solar tracker system. Our aim is to design a dual axis solar tracker system. The sun is tracked by the tracker and its position is changed in such a way that it maximizes the power output. The solar panel is moved by two geared DC motors so that sunâ€™s light is able to remain aligned with the    solar panel. The operation of experimental model of the device is based on a DC motor which is intelligently controlled by a dedicated drive until that moves a mini photovoltaic panel, the presence of the two simple but efficient light sensors receive signals by a microcontroller. The performance and characteristics of the solar tracker device are experimentally analyzed.
