1.SOLAR TRACKER 
Solar tracking is a mechanism by which we can create a system to tilt the solar panel in the direction of movement of the sun. It is essential to perform sun tracking, in order to enhance the performance of the system. It can result in the collection of more than 30% extra energy from the same collector. Solar tracking system approaches with higher accuracy can be achieved by Single Axis schemes and Dual axis structure.

1.1.Single Axis Solar Tracker 
Single Axis trackers have one axis of rotation. There are several possibilities for implementation of Single Axis solar trackers. Which include horizontal single axis trackers (HSAT), horizontal single axis tracker with tilted modules (HTSAT), vertical single axis trackers (VSAT), tilted single axis trackers (TSAT) and polar aligned single axis trackers (PSAT)? The tracking schemes are designed such that maximum beam of radiation over given period of time collected. The use of single axis solar tracker can increase the electricity output as much 
as 27% to 32%.

1.2.Dual Axis Solar Tracker 
Dual Axis Solar trackers have two degree axis of rotation one is along vertical axis and another is along horizontal axis. It gives maximum solar exposure because of its ability to follow the sun, irrespective of sun position in the sky, dual axis trackers enable the PV panel to align itself in the direction of sun. In dual axis solar tracker vertical axis follows the angular height position of the sun in the sky and horizontal axis follows the east to west movement of the sun. According to, dual axis tracking shows 35% to 40% increase in power output.

2.Arduino
Arduino is the type of microcontroller. The purpose of microcontroller is to control the position of motor. so At mega 328p microcontroller is used. Arduino consist of 6 analog inputs and 14 digital i/o ports out of them 6 acts as pwm signals. In addition to this it consist of 16 MHZ crystal oscillator, a USB cable through which program is dumped. And Arduino get powered by the power jack. Advantages of Arduino is low cost, robust construction and platform independent.

3.Solar Panel
Solar energy is the photovoltaic cell which convert light energy received from sun into electrical energy. The name behind “solar” panel is they grab high powerful energy emitted from the sun. The solar panel finds its applications in street lights , domestic and industrial areas.

4.Servo Motor
Servo motor Servo motor is three wired dc motor which works on the principal of servo mechanism. servo motor can rotate upto maximum angle of 180degrees. In our proposed project 4.8V motor is used. Since it is dual axis system two servo motors are used for east-west and north-south directions respectively. Servo motors are powered by PWM output received from the Arduino.

5.Light Dependent Resistor(ldr)
Ldr are also named as photo conductors (or) photo resistors. Which works on the principal of photo conductivity. ldr resistance decrease with increase in light intensity and vice versa. Ldr s are mainly used for sensing purpose in order to catch the solar energy and provide analog input to arduino.


WORKING PRINCIPLE
                      
The proposed tracking system tracks sunlight more effectively by providing PV panel rotation along two different axis.
The tracker is composed of four LDR sensors, two stepper motors and PIC microcontroller. A pair of sensors and one motor is used to tilt the tracker in suns east-west direction
and the other pair of sensors and the motor which is fixed at the bottom of the tracker is used to tilt the tracker in the suns north-south direction.
Two stepper motors are all in use in this system. Upper panel holder stepper motor tracks the sun linearly and base stepper motor tracks the parabolic displacement of the sun. These stepper motors and sensors are interfaced with a microcontroller .The microcontroller gives the command to the motors on the basis of sensors input. LDR sensors sense the light and sends signal to microcontroller.

4.It can be used solar street lightning system.
5.It may be used in water treatment technologies and solar heating.
